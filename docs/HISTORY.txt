------------------

  fixes a bug where a cached sitemap.xml.gz is delivered with information that
  only an user with more privilegs is allowed to see. We also make sure that
  the cached file was build with a current catalog by adding the catalog
  counter to the cache key. Based on a patch by stxnext.  Fixes
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8402
  [stxnext, csenger]

  [stefan]


1.1.7 - December 15, 2008

  This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/4576

  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7758.

  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8323
  [calvinhp]

  so they can be called without a request (which is not used at all).
  Deprecate parameters which were not in the interface and were never used.
  [wichert]

  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7575 and
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7573
  [limi]

  have a portal_type.  This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8028.
  [davisagli]

  portal_type. This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8246.
  [hannosch]

- Adjusted deprecation warnings to point to Plone 4.0 instead of Plone 3.5
  since we changed the version numbering again.
  [hannosch]

1.1.3 Released July 7th, 2008
------------------------------

- Made PersonalBarViewlet tolerate users who don't have a Plone user object, as
  when using OpenID or apachepas. This fixes
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7296.
  [erikrose]

- Use 'index' attribute rather than 'render' for setting viewlet templates, so
  that they can be overridden using the 'template' ZCML attribute.
  [davisagli]

1.1.0 Released April 20th, 2008
-------------------------------

- Applied patch from http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7942 to ensure that the
  'currentParent' marker is not True for items that have a path that is a
  substring of the true path.
  [optilude]

- Made handling of self.context in portal.py consistent.

- Rename the portal_url instance variable to site_url in the ViewletBase
  class. This prevents getToolByName(..., 'portal_url') from returning
  the URL string instead of the portal_url tool, which can causes unexpected
  and subtle breakage. portal_url is still available but produces a deprecation
  warning. It will be removed in Plone 4.
  [wichert]

- Added viewlet for RSS link.
  [fschulze]

- Added dependency on plone.app.viewletmanager.
  [fschulze]

  has an out-of-date schema.  Can happen when migrating from Plone
  2.5 to 3.0. Fall back to False for those attributes then.
  [maurits]
