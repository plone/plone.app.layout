  Fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10640.
  [davisagli]

- Add an 'icons-on' class to the body when icons are enabled, so that icons
  applied via CSS can also be controlled.
  [davisagli]


2.0b8 - 2010-06-03
------------------

- Only show the history link in the byline on the default view. This avoids
  having the links in folder listing views.
  [hannosch]

- The condition on the author link in the byline was reversed.
  [rossp]

- Document byline should not show history link to anonymous users.
  [elro]


2.0b7 - 2010-05-03
------------------

- Fixed personal_bar.pt to not repeat the UL tag for each user action.
  This fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10481
  [xMartin, dunlapm]

- Fixed CMFContentIcon to not return a url if the getIcon lookup fails
  in the same way that brain-based icons do. This fixes
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10466
  [dunlapm]

- Cleaned up content history viewlets and overlays by eliminating
  superfluous div tags from the output.
  [dunlapm]

- Added apple-touch-icon (iPhone/iPad home screen icon) definition to
  favicon.pt
  [limi]


2.0b6 - 2010-04-07
------------------

- The catalog brains icon return no icon if the type's icon_expr is
  empty.
  [rossp]

- Extend the have_portlets check to make it possible to force a portlet column
  to be enabled even if there are no portlets.
  [davisagli]

- Simplified Related Items to use a definition list instead of a fieldset -
  it's really not a form.
  [limi]

- Change keyword/tag viewlet to be independent of the surrounding language,
  and to have a class on the separator, so it can be removed when the styling
  requires it.
  [limi]

- Update viewlets so that this package now defines the viewlet configuration
  required by the Sunburst theme, and plonetheme.classic overrides that to
  achieve the old viewlet positions.
  [davisagli]


2.0b5 - 2010-03-05
------------------

- Make icon descriptions' lookup of portal_type title less brittle for missing
  portal_types (fall back to the portal_type id).
  [davisagli]

- Further optimize the related_items view by avoiding an algorithm with
  quadratic complexity.
  [hannosch]


2.0b4 - 2010-02-18
------------------

- Updated history_view.pt to the recent markup conventions.
  References http://dev.plone.org/old/plone/ticket/9981
  [spliter]


2.0b3 - 2010-02-17
------------------

- Speed up related items viewlet by returning catalog brains instead of
  full objects.
  [stefan]

- Updated dashboard.pt to follow recent markup conventions.
  References http://dev.plone.org/old/plone/ticket/9981
  [spliter]

- Moved condition for .contentViews and .contentActions to div#edit-bar to not
  include #edit-bar in tabs should not be rendered.
  [spliter]

- Disabled columns in dashboard.pt with REQUEST variables according to the
  recent conventions.
  [spliter]

- Removing redundant .documentContent markup.
  This refs http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10231.
  [limi]

- Moved the prepareObjectTabs method from the @@plone view to the contentviews
  viewlet and introduced a class for the viewlet.
  [hannosch]

- Introduce a new @@plone_layout globals view, which contains methods from the
  @@plone view and which were commonly overridden to change layout policies.
  [hannosch]

- Moved the history link back into the byline. This refs
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10102.
  [hannosch]

- Add html id to personal bar actions.
  [paul_r]

- Created several modifications of the content history viewlet to act as
  standalone history page and simple popup. Old collapsible history viewlet
  is still in place, ready to be wired in with zcml for anyone who needs the
  old behavior.
  [smcmahon]

- Fixed broken reference to portal_workflow in document_relateditems-viewlet
  [tom_gross]


2.0b2 - 2010-01-31
------------------

- Use the same designation for "Plone" in the portal footer and the
  colophon.
  Fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9741.
  [dukebody]


2.0b1 - 2010-01-25
------------------

- Micro-optimization for skip_links viewlet.
  [hannosch]

- Update presentation fullscreen view to match current main_template's.
  [hannosch]

- Simplify the TAL of the dublin core viewlet.
  [hannosch]

- Avoid the overhead of a DateTime class in the footer.
  [hannosch]

- Optimized the related items viewlet.
  [hannosch]

- Avoid looking a "request/SearchableText|nothing" expression. Looking things
  up in the entire request which aren't there most of the time is actually
  somewhat slow.
  [hannosch]

- Optimized the content history viewlet.
  [hannosch]

- Optimize TAL code of the byline viewlet.
  [hannosch]

- Registered new viewlet for related items instead of using a macro.

------------------

- Use the getIconExprObject method of the FTI instead of the deprecated
  getIcon method.
  [hannosch]

- Specified package dependencies.
  [hannosch]

- Use the correct ViewPageTemplateFile from Five for the links viewlets.
  [hannosch]


2.0a4 - 2009-12-16
------------------

- Do not let the homelink in the personal bar viewlet point to the
  author page but to the personalize_form (or dashboard).
  Fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8707
  [maurits]

- ``plone.htmlhead.title`` was not editable TTW. This closes
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9488.
  [hannosch]


2.0a3 - 2009-12-02
------------------

- Properly placed path bar above the content.
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9860
  [spliter]

- plone.manage_portlets_fallback viewlet's implementation
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9808
  [spliter]

- Only show diff and revert buttons for most recent version if it
  differs from the working copy.
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9803
  [alecm]

- Remove review_state from version history info, it's not always there
  and we weren't using it.
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9816
  [alecm]

- Pass the creator id to /author/ as a parameter if it contains a '/', such
  as openid users.
  [matthewwilkes]

- Portal logo has to have 'title' attribute for better accessibility.
  [spliter]


2.0a2 - 2009-11-15
------------------

- Package metadata cleanup.
  [hannosch]

- Avoid calling lots of Python scripts from inside the content history viewlet
  and use methods on the view instead.
  [hannosch]


2.0a1 - 2009-11-15
------------------

- Moved plone.path_bar to the plone.abovecontenttitle viewlet
  manager, breadcrumbs should be close to the title of the current document.
  [limi]

- It's no longer the dashboard's responsibility to supply prefs/profile links
  now that they are located in the user menu.
  The code uses the "group" terminology here though, so I'm wondering if this is
  related to group dashboards. If I broke anything, let me know.
  [limi]

- Micro-optimize the icons views.
  [hannosch]

- Merged the ``selectedTabs`` Python script into the GlobalSectionsViewlet.
  [hannosch]

- Take advantage of icons being found on the actions themselves now instead
  and avoid the getIconFor indirection.
  [hannosch]

- Removed the special default page and translation handling. LinguaPlone uses
  a content language negotiator per default instead.
  [hannosch]

- Add a viewlet to display the Dublin Core metadata added in
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket9272
  [esteele]

- Added support for group dashboards to the dashboard view.
  [optilude]

- Greatly simplify the default colophon, so it stands a chance of staying on
  actual sites. We cannot claim any standards support for public sites, only
  for Plone itself.
  [hannosch]

- Changed the is_rtl method of the portal state view not to rely on the locale
  but use a much simpler test based on the language code. This avoids setting
  up the expensive request.locale.
  [hannosch]

- Fixed the portal state view to look for uppercase language in the request,
  since that is set by PloneLanguageTool. This closes
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8342.
  [hannosch]

- "Log in to add comments" button is now a link and respects the login URL
  specified in portal_actions. Closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9071.
  [erikrose]

- Fixed is_rtl test to work with new locale based approach.
  [hannosch]

- Removed memoizing for things which are only used once in a page.
  [hannosch]

- Replaced direct invocations of interfaces with queryAdapter calls. The
  former does a suboptimal getattr call internally.
  [hannosch]

- Sanitized the actions handling on the context state view. You can pass in
  an action category into the action method now, which is the preferred way.
  This allows us to avoid evaluating all actions in the current context if
  we are only interested in some of the categories.
  [hannosch]

- Since Zope 2.11 the locale is available on the request. Removed our special
  code from the portal state view and rely directly on the request.
  [hannosch]

- Changed ViewletBase so viewlets can be registered as zope.contentproviders.
  This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7868.
  [hannosch]

- Purge old zope2 Interface interfaces for Zope 2.12 compatibility.
  [elro]


1.2.5 - 2009-08-01
------------------

- In the history viewlet, moved again the arrows inside a span, it's really needed to apply a style.
  [vincentfretin]


1.2.4 - 2009-07-04
------------------

- In the history viewlet, internationalized the Compare link and replaced
  icons by plain text. The revert link is now a POST button. This closes
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9064
  [limi, vincentfretin]


1.2.3 - 2009-06-12
------------------

- Fix issue when dealing with empty version histories in history viewlet.
  [alecm]


1.2.2 - 2009-06-11
------------------

- Make ContentHistoryViewlet use new metadata only history method to
  speed up listing.
  [alecm]

- Make ContentHistoryViewlet check if context isVersionable.
  [elro]


1.2.1 - 2009-05-20
------------------

- Changed the search and author header links to respect the navigation root.
  [hannosch]


1.2 - 2009-05-16
----------------

- Filter not-interesting history entries in content history viewlet. This
  prevents an empty history viewlet from being shown.
  [wichert]

- Add a new content history viewlet which combines the full workflow history
  and content versions. Render this instead of the workflow history viewlet.
  [wichert]

- Fixed querystring in CSS validation link in viewlets/colophon.pt
  There was an ampersand where the leading "?" should have been.
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9054
  [siebo]

- Fixed "region-content" id twice in dashboard.pt, replaced one by "content".
  Fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8932
  [vincentfretin]

- Author link tag should follow same rules as byline viewlet.
  [elro]


1.2rc1 - 2009-03-20
-------------------

- Fixed i18n in content_history template.
  There were two nested msgids and dynamic content.
  [vincentfretin]

- Removed stray span tags in the comment byline.
  [limi]


1.2b1 - 2009-03-07
------------------

- Added navigation_root_url to the common viewlets base class. Adjusted the
  various viewlets templates to use the new attribute. Changed the dashboard
  view to be available on an INavigationRoot.
  This implements http://plone.org/products/plone/roadmap/234
  [calvinhp]

- Default to using the content history viewlet instead of the workflow history
  viewlet.
  [wichert]

- Add options to show differences between consecutive versions, and revert to
  and preview older revisions to the content history viewlet.
  [wichert]

- Use the new history view from CMFEditions instead of the crufty old form.
  [wichert]


1.1.8 - 2009-03-07
------------------

- Adjust the caching of sitemap.xml.gz. We only cache for anonymous users. That
  fixes a bug where a cached sitemap.xml.gz is delivered with information that
  only an user with more privilegs is allowed to see. We also make sure that
  the cached file was build with a current catalog by adding the catalog
  counter to the cache key. Based on a patch by stxnext.  Fixes
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8402
  [stxnext, csenger]

- Added time_only for use with toLocalizedTime so that event_view now localizes
  the start/end times if the start/end dates are the same. Closes
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8607
  [jnelson, calvinhp]

- Fixed Plone 3.1 backward compatibility of above.
  [stefan]


1.1.7 - 2008-12-15
------------------

- Modified user profile item on the dashboard to use an image tag
  instead of a background image. This makes it more consistent with
  the other list items and easier to style for RTL scripts.
  [emanlove]


1.1.6 - 2008-11-21
------------------

- Avoid a test failure caused by test interdependencies.
  [hannosch]

- Fixed tests for the language method of the portal state view.
  [hannosch]

- Fixed keywords.pt to properly encode ampersands in its links. This closes
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8509
  [younga3, dunlapm]

- Fixed site_icon so that we would have flipped icon in case of RTL.
  This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/4576
  [spliter]

- Fixed generation of links to author.cpt for user IDs that are a URL
  (OpenID users, e.g.).  This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8040
  [davisagli]

- Add some tests on private contents for sitemap.xml.gz generation.  This
  closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8402
  [encolpe]


1.1.5 - 2008-08-18
------------------

- Fixed an invalid message id for the dashboard. This closes
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7758.
  [hannosch]

- Fixed comments.pt to pass the title of the comment you are replying to into
  the discussion_reply_form. This closes
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8323
  [calvinhp]

- Refactor default_page: move all logic out of the view to separate methods
  so they can be called without a request (which is not used at all).
  Deprecate parameters which were not in the interface and were never used.
  [wichert]

- Added note that Javascript is required for presentation mode. This closes
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7575 and
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7573
  [limi]

- Fixed plone_context_state's view_url method to work with contexts that don't
  have a portal_type.  This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8028.
  [davisagli]

- Changed IContentIcon to expose users to the title of the FTI instead of the
  portal_type. This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8246.
  [hannosch]

- Adjusted deprecation warnings to point to Plone 4.0 instead of Plone 3.5
  since we changed the version numbering again.
  [hannosch]


1.1.3 - 2008-07-07
------------------

- Made PersonalBarViewlet tolerate users who don't have a Plone user object, as
  when using OpenID or apachepas. This fixes
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7296.
  [erikrose]

- Use 'index' attribute rather than 'render' for setting viewlet templates, so
  that they can be overridden using the 'template' ZCML attribute.
  [davisagli]


1.1.0 - 2008-04-20
------------------

- Applied patch from http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7942 to ensure that the
  'currentParent' marker is not True for items that have a path that is a
  substring of the true path.
  [optilude]

- Displaying 'Anonymous User' also when the comment creator is an empty
  string. This fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7712.
  [rsantos]

- Allow the use of the icon attribute on action directly instead of using the
  actionicons tool.
  [hannosch]

- Fix invalid leading space in all 'Up to Site Setup' links.
  [wichert]

- Fixed permission in workflow history viewlet. This closes
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/5507.
  [hannosch]

- Made handling of self.context in portal.py consistent.
  [hannosch]

- Rename the portal_url instance variable to site_url in the ViewletBase
  class. This prevents getToolByName(..., 'portal_url') from returning
  the URL string instead of the portal_url tool, which can causes unexpected
  and subtle breakage. portal_url is still available but produces a deprecation
  warning. It will be removed in Plone 4.
  [wichert]

- Added viewlet for RSS link.
  [fschulze]

- Added dependency on plone.app.viewletmanager.
  [fschulze]

- Make viewlet managers in head section order- and filterable.
  [fschulze]


1.0.6 - 2008-09-10
------------------

- Added i18n markup to nextprevious.pt.
  This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7537.
  [hannosch]

- Catch KeyError for presentation or tableContents when document
  has an out-of-date schema.  Can happen when migrating from Plone
  2.5 to 3.0. Fall back to False for those attributes then.
  [maurits]


1.0.5 - 2008-01-03
------------------

- Do not create an empty <ul> in the personal actions bar if there are
  no items in it. This fixes an XHTML syntax error.
  [wichert]


1.0.4 - 2007-12-06
------------------

- Added i18n domain to comment.pt.
  [martior]

- Allow non ascii characters in webstats_js code.
  Fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7359
  [naro]

- Fixed workflow history viewlet to handle entries with
  usernames that don't exist any more (deleted users) and
  also anonymous users.
  This fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7250.
  [rsantos]


1.0.3 - 2007-11-09
------------------

- Made getIcon urls relative to portal root.
  [tesdal]


1.0.2 - 2007-10-08
------------------

- Fixed getIcon code for use with ++resource++ and to use a safer method
  of getting the correct url.
  [optilude]

- Upgraded the sitemap template to conform with the 0.9 specs from
  http://www.sitemaps.org and fixed the caching to use the filename.
  [deo]


1.0.1.1 - 2007-09-10
--------------------

- Lower logging level of 'no associated workflow' to avoid a log entry
  on each view.
  [ldr]

  [naro]

- Avoid locking on non lockable types in byline viewlet.
  [jfroche]

- Added website statistics inclusion viewlet to configure.zcml so it
  actually works.
  [fschulze]

- Made code in defaultpage.py a bit more tolerant of missing tools.
  [hannosch]


1.0 - 2007-08-17
----------------

- Fixed the translation of the 'Show this page in presentation mode...'
  message.
  [hannosch]

- Made the search box a bit wider, so the entire default text is shown
  in languages with a rather long term.
  [hannosch]

- Show the authors full name in presentation view. This fixes
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6810
