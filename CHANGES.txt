  superfluous div tags from the output.

- Simplified Related Items to use a definition list instead of a fieldset -
  it's really not a form.
  [limi]

  and to have a class on the separator, so it can be removed when the styling
  requires it.
  [limi]

- Avoid the overhead of a DateTime class in the footer.
  [hannosch]

  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9488.
  [hannosch]


2.0a3 - 2009-12-02
------------------

- Properly placed path bar above the content.

  differs from the working copy.
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9803

2.0a2 - 2009-11-15
------------------

  and use methods on the view instead.
  [hannosch]


2.0a1 - 2009-11-15
------------------

- Moved plone.path_bar to the plone.abovecontenttitle viewlet
  manager, breadcrumbs should be close to the title of the current document.
  [limi]

- It's no longer the dashboard's responsibility to supply prefs/profile links
  now that they are located in the user menu.
  The code uses the "group" terminology here though, so I'm wondering if this is
  related to group dashboards. If I broke anything, let me know.
  [limi]

- Micro-optimize the icons views.
  [hannosch]

- Merged the ``selectedTabs`` Python script into the GlobalSectionsViewlet.
  [hannosch]

- Take advantage of icons being found on the actions themselves now instead
  and avoid the getIconFor indirection.

  a content language negotiator per default instead.
  [hannosch]

- Add a viewlet to display the Dublin Core metadata added in
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket9272
  [esteele]

- Added support for group dashboards to the dashboard view.
  [optilude]

  actual sites. We cannot claim any standards support for public sites, only
  for Plone itself.
  [hannosch]

- Changed the is_rtl method of the portal state view not to rely on the locale
  but use a much simpler test based on the language code. This avoids setting
  up the expensive request.locale.
  [hannosch]

- Fixed the portal state view to look for uppercase language in the request,
  since that is set by PloneLanguageTool. This closes
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8342.
  [hannosch]

- "Log in to add comments" button is now a link and respects the login URL
  specified in portal_actions. Closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9071.

- Fixed is_rtl test to work with new locale based approach.
  [hannosch]

- Removed memoizing for things which are only used once in a page.
  [hannosch]

- Replaced direct invocations of interfaces with queryAdapter calls. The
  former does a suboptimal getattr call internally.
  [hannosch]

- Sanitized the actions handling on the context state view. You can pass in
  an action category into the action method now, which is the preferred way.
  This allows us to avoid evaluating all actions in the current context if
  we are only interested in some of the categories.
  [hannosch]

- Since Zope 2.11 the locale is available on the request. Removed our special
  code from the portal state view and rely directly on the request.
  [hannosch]

- Changed ViewletBase so viewlets can be registered as zope.contentproviders.
  This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7868.
  [hannosch]

- Purge old zope2 Interface interfaces for Zope 2.12 compatibility.
  [elro]

  icons by plain text. The revert link is now a POST button. This closes

  [limi, vincentfretin]


1.2.3 - 2009-06-12
------------------

- Changed the search and author header links to respect the navigation root.
  [hannosch]


1.2 - 2009-05-16
----------------

- Filter not-interesting history entries in content history viewlet. This
  prevents an empty history viewlet from being shown.
  [wichert]

- Add a new content history viewlet which combines the full workflow history
  and content versions. Render this instead of the workflow history viewlet.
  [wichert]

- Fixed querystring in CSS validation link in viewlets/colophon.pt
  There was an ampersand where the leading "?" should have been.
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9054
  [siebo]

  Fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8932
  [vincentfretin]

  [elro]

-------------------

  There were two nested msgids and dynamic content.
  [vincentfretin]

- Removed stray span tags in the comment byline.
  [limi]


1.2b1 - 2009-03-07
------------------

- Added navigation_root_url to the common viewlets base class. Adjusted the
  various viewlets templates to use the new attribute. Changed the dashboard
  view to be available on an INavigationRoot.
  This implements http://plone.org/products/plone/roadmap/234
  [calvinhp]

- Default to using the content history viewlet instead of the workflow history
  viewlet.
  [wichert]

- Add options to show differences between consecutive versions, and revert to
  and preview older revisions to the content history viewlet.
  [wichert]

- Use the new history view from CMFEditions instead of the crufty old form.
  [wichert]


1.1.8 - 2009-03-07
------------------

- Adjust the caching of sitemap.xml.gz. We only cache for anonymous users. That
  fixes a bug where a cached sitemap.xml.gz is delivered with information that
  only an user with more privilegs is allowed to see. We also make sure that
  the cached file was build with a current catalog by adding the catalog
  counter to the cache key. Based on a patch by stxnext.  Fixes
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8402
  [stxnext, csenger]

- Added time_only for use with toLocalizedTime so that event_view now localizes
  the start/end times if the start/end dates are the same. Closes

  [stefan]


1.1.7 - 2008-12-15

------------------

- Avoid a test failure caused by test interdependencies.
  [hannosch]

  This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/4576

  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7758.

  so they can be called without a request (which is not used at all).
  Deprecate parameters which were not in the interface and were never used.

  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7575 and
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7573
  [limi]

  have a portal_type.  This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8028.
  [davisagli]

- Changed IContentIcon to expose users to the title of the FTI instead of the
  portal_type. This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8246.
  [hannosch]

- Adjusted deprecation warnings to point to Plone 4.0 instead of Plone 3.5
  since we changed the version numbering again.
  [hannosch]


1.1.3 - 2008-07-07
------------------

- Made PersonalBarViewlet tolerate users who don't have a Plone user object, as
  when using OpenID or apachepas. This fixes
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7296.
  [erikrose]

- Use 'index' attribute rather than 'render' for setting viewlet templates, so
  that they can be overridden using the 'template' ZCML attribute.
  [davisagli]


1.1.0 - 2008-04-20
------------------

- Applied patch from http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7942 to ensure that the
  'currentParent' marker is not True for items that have a path that is a
  substring of the true path.
  [optilude]

- Displaying 'Anonymous User' also when the comment creator is an empty
  string. This fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7712.
  [rsantos]

- Allow the use of the icon attribute on action directly instead of using the
  actionicons tool.
  [hannosch]

- Fix invalid leading space in all 'Up to Site Setup' links.
  [wichert]

- Fixed permission in workflow history viewlet. This closes
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/5507.
  [hannosch]

- Made handling of self.context in portal.py consistent.
  [hannosch]

- Rename the portal_url instance variable to site_url in the ViewletBase
  class. This prevents getToolByName(..., 'portal_url') from returning
  the URL string instead of the portal_url tool, which can causes unexpected
  and subtle breakage. portal_url is still available but produces a deprecation
  warning. It will be removed in Plone 4.
  [wichert]

- Added viewlet for RSS link.
  [fschulze]

- Added dependency on plone.app.viewletmanager.
  [fschulze]

- Make viewlet managers in head section order- and filterable.
  [fschulze]


1.0.6 - 2008-09-10
------------------

- Added i18n markup to nextprevious.pt.
  This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7537.
  [hannosch]

- Catch KeyError for presentation or tableContents when document
  has an out-of-date schema.  Can happen when migrating from Plone
  2.5 to 3.0. Fall back to False for those attributes then.
  [maurits]


1.0.5 - 2008-01-03
------------------

- Do not create an empty <ul> in the personal actions bar if there are
  no items in it. This fixes an XHTML syntax error.
  [wichert]


1.0.4 - 2007-12-06
------------------

- Added i18n domain to comment.pt.
  [martior]

- Allow non ascii characters in webstats_js code.
  Fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7359
  [naro]

- Fixed workflow history viewlet to handle entries with
  usernames that don't exist any more (deleted users) and
  also anonymous users.
  This fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7250.
  [rsantos]


1.0.3 - 2007-11-09
------------------

- Made getIcon urls relative to portal root.
  [tesdal]


1.0.2 - 2007-10-08
------------------

- Fixed getIcon code for use with ++resource++ and to use a safer method
  of getting the correct url.
  [optilude]

- Upgraded the sitemap template to conform with the 0.9 specs from
  http://www.sitemaps.org and fixed the caching to use the filename.
  [deo]


1.0.1.1 - 2007-09-10
--------------------

- Lower logging level of 'no associated workflow' to avoid a log entry
  on each view.
  [ldr]

- Fixed default language in globals.
  [wichert]

- Fixed link to actor in history viewlet.
  [naro]

- Avoid locking on non lockable types in byline viewlet.

  actually works.
  [fschulze]

- Made code in defaultpage.py a bit more tolerant of missing tools.
  [hannosch]


1.0 - 2007-08-17
----------------

- Fixed the translation of the 'Show this page in presentation mode...'
  message.
  [hannosch]

- Made the search box a bit wider, so the entire default text is shown
  in languages with a rather long term.
  [hannosch]

- Show the authors full name in presentation view. This fixes
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6810
